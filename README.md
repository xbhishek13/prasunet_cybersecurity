# Prasunet Cybersecurity

Welcome to the `prasunet_cybersecurity` repository. This repository is dedicated to various cybersecurity and cryptography tasks provided by Prasunet PVT. LTD. Each task is designed to address different aspects of cybersecurity, offering practical solutions and hands-on experience with critical concepts.

## Overview

The repository includes Python programs and tools for various cybersecurity applications:

1. **Prasunet_CS_01: Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption**:
   This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. Users can input a message and specify a shift value to transform the text, demonstrating fundamental principles of encryption and decryption. The Caesar Cipher is a basic substitution cipher that helps understand the concept of encryption.

2. **Prasunet_CS_02: Image Encryption Tool**:
   This tool provides a simple approach to image encryption through pixel manipulation. Users can perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical transformations to each pixel. This task illustrates the basics of image encryption, showcasing how pixel-level operations can be used to obscure image data.

3. **Prasunet_CS_03: Password Complexity Checker**:
   The Password Complexity Checker evaluates the strength of passwords based on several criteria, including length, and the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool is designed to help users create more secure passwords by assessing their complexity and providing feedback.

4. **Prasunet_CS_04: Simple Keylogger**:
   This script records and logs keystrokes. It is crucial to use keyloggers ethically and with permission, as unauthorized use can violate privacy. This task demonstrates basic keylogging functionality and is intended for educational purposes.

5. **Prasunet_CS_05: Network Packet Analyzer**:
   This packet sniffer tool captures and analyzes network packets, displaying information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. It provides insights into network traffic and is useful for understanding network communication.
